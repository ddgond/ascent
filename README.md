# Ascent
Ascent is an experience I created as part of a team for the class
2.S972 (Virtual Reality, Sound, and Cinema) at MIT, in collaboration
with Berklee and Harvard. I was in charge of programming on this project
and learned a lot about developing for VR through it. I also learned how
to use FMOD (both FMOD Studio and the Unity integration) to bring in the
music.
